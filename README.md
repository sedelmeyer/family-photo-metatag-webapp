# familyphoto-metatag-webapp

**This project is still in the early stages of development. Check back for updates over the coming weeks.**

**And please bear with me, I am learning Flask as I work my way through this project.**

## Summary

This is meant to be a simple web application for collaborative meta-tagging of personal family photo archives, thus allowing family members to view and add comments to each photo such as dates, event details, pictured individuals' names, etc.

The resulting database of comments is then used to title, organize, and embed metadata into the original digital photo files prior to archiving and sharing.

## Technologies

Built with Python, Flask, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL in a Docker development environment
